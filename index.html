"He starts his laptop and waits for any sign of malfunction. Nothing... His laptop worked perfectly.

Sid noticed that it was still raining outside. His mind started racing. It hadn't rained for days; the climate was pretty dry earlier. The elements in the garbage must be wet or washed away which must have caused disruption in its pathway to affect electronics.

He remembered the day when he found the loner sitting and sniffing on the street. He remembered the stench was awful to smell. What if the stench wasn't what it seemed to be? What if those were fumes? He knew anything that was radioactive should affect humans too. But he seemed to be perfectly fine."</i></p>
